    "SuggetContent1": "I ordered a new 2023 Z4 M40i from BMW Sydney and my experience with them has been nothing short of exceptional! I come to this verdict after 9 months of being in touch with the BMW Sydney team, from placing the order to receiving the car. It’s fair to say they delivered on ever step of the way.\n\nI especially want to recognise the exceptional customer experience provided for Nico Lati. His help and advice throughout the process were remarkable and his commitment to making this a memorable experience did not go unnoticed. He’s definitely the most genuine car sales manager I’ve come across. I’m not sure if I’m more impressed by the car or the service that was provided!\n\nAs a customer I felt heard and valued. Hero and Stephen also did an exceptional job in getting me an excellent trade in price and laid out some great finance options. I can confidently say, no matter what your situation, Nico Lati and the wider team at BMW Sydney can have you sorted and driving your dream car in no time! I have no doubt that they are the best at what they do. If I could rate them higher than 5 stars I would!",
